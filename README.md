# BivalveBitMax
 BivalveBit with MAX3010x heart sensor

This is a branch of the original BivalveBit software at http://github.com/millerlp/BivalveBit

This version is meant to talk to a MAX30102 (or MAX30101) pulse oximeter sensor on a Mussel Heart board Rev B. It also 
communicates with the standard Allegro A1395 Hall effect sensor. BivalveBit boards use an ATmega4808 microcontroller. 

This software is written in the Arduino environment.
